    "## Setting up the environment\n",
    "In order to follow this exercise, you'll need SQLite3 installed.  Binaries for Windows, Linux, and Mac can all be obtained on their [webpage](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're on windows, be sure to get both the precompiled binaries for your OS as well as the `sqlite-tools`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have it installed, type `sqlite3` into your OS console.  If you see a prompt saying `sqlite>`, all is in order and you're ready to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "SQL, often pronounced \"see-quell\", stands for Structured Query Langauge and is the language used to query relational databases.  Although you may have never actually worked with a relational database, you are probably already very familiar with their structure and concepts, likely through working with spreadsheet programs like Excel.  To review, here are some of the basic ideas.\n",
    "- Data are organized into *tables*, like spreadsheets using the Excel analogy.\n",
    "- *Tables* consist of named *columns* and zero or more *rows*\n",
    "- *Columns* contain a data type (integer, float, string, etc...)\n",
    "- *Rows* may be indexed by a *primary key* which is a column, or a set of columns, used to uniquely identify each row."

    "## Import some data\n",
    "Before getting into writing queries, we first need to load some data.  We're going to use the `mtcars` dataset that is often used in R and Python examples.  If you need a copy of the .csv, it can be downloaded [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html), and it may be a good idea to familiarize yourself with the data a bit before proceeding.  Also, be sure that all columns have a name.  Once you have the data, put it in the same directory as this notebook.  Now open up a command prompt in your OS, navigate to the directory containing the data, and run the command `sqlite3`.  You should now see a `sqlite3>` indicating that the server is running and ready for commands.  Now enter the following into the `sqlite3` console."

    "The `*` is the wildcard character and in this context it can be read as \"all\".  The `SELECT` clause is followed by `FROM` which specifies which table the preceding columns will be selected from.  Anything that comes after the `FROM` works to operate or \"filter\" on the resultant rows, in our case, limiting the number of rows returned.  So with that in mind, the above SQL statement reads \"select all (columns) from (table) mtcars limit(ed to) 10 (rows)\".  Also note that the `SQL` statement ended with a `;` which means \"end of command\".  Some `SQL` software require its use while others do not.  When using the `sqlite3` console, we must always terminate our statements with a `;`.\n",

It is **very** important to keep in mind however, that `GROUP BY` will group by each *unique* value in the columns.  This isn't a problem here since there are only 3 unique values of `cyl`, but what if we had, for example, grouped by `wt` or some other column that had many more unique values?  Well, `GROUP BY` will return a table with a number of rows equal to the number of unique values.  On small datasets, this isn't too much of a problem, but when working with a very large database, `GROUP BY` and aggregate function calls can be a bit taxing and can really slow things down, or potentially lock up your client (and irrate your DBA) if you aren't careful.\n",
