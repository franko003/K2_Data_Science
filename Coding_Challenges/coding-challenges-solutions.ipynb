    "over in the array. Then to solve the challenge we would just loop through the string, and if a letter is\n",

    "the letter in the string with that new letter. This would be a solution to the challenge, but the running\n",
    "time involves both the length of the string n and the length of the consonant array m because we are\n",
    "looping through the string while also searching for a letter in the array each time. The running time\n",
    "still reduces to O(n) because the consonant array stays constant meaning it will never get shorter or\n",
    "longer because there is a set amount of constants in the alphabet. So this solution is pretty good, but\n",
    "we can actually do a bit better.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this solution a bit faster we can actualy get rid of the consonant array altogether.\n",
    "This is because we can convert each letter as we go to its character code number, add 1 to it, and\n",
    "then convert this number back to a letter to get the next letter in the alphabet. Then we simply\n",
    "perform an extra check to make sure the new letter is not a vowel, but if so, simply add 1 more to its\n",
    "character code to get the next letter.\n",
    "\n",
